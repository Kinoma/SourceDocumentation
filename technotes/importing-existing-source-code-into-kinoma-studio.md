This note explains how to import existing source code files into a new Kinoma Studio application project.

Kinoma Studio makes it easy to get started building KinomaJS apps. The Application Project wizard, templates and content assist features quickly guide you through the steps required to setup an application project and develop code. That said, often times you have existing JavaScript code you want to use in your Kinoma apps. Here we explain how to do just that.

> Note: You can download and learn more about Kinoma Studio [here](../../../../develop/studio/).

***
To import your sources, you first need to create a Kinoma application project in Kinoma Studio. Choose “New” > “Application Project” from the “File” menu

***
The application project wizard allows you to configure your new application. You tap the “Next” button to navigate through each step. To start, choose a project name and location. In this example, my project name is MyApp and I chose the default location.

***
Next configure the application settings by entering an application ID, title, and version number.

> Note: The application ID requires at least two components separated by a period in order to export the application to Android.

***
Next add any modules you plan to use in your application. In this example, I added several built-in libraries commonly used by KinomaJS mobile apps.

> Note: This step is optional. Libraries/modules can be added after creating your project.

***
In the last step you choose an application template. The choice isn’t critical, especially if you plan to replace the main program file. Here I chose the JavaScript template, since MyApp source code contains no KinomaXML files.

***
Tap the “Finish” button and the new application project is added to the Project Explorer workspace with an empty main.js program file.

***
Now you simply drag and drop to add your source code into the project. Navigate to the sources on your computer and drop them into the project. Here, I drop my source code into the project’s “src” directory created by the template.

You will be prompted to replace any duplicate files. In this example I chose to replace the main.js file generated by the template with the copy from my computer.

> Note: Remember to include the required //@module and //@program comments at the top of your JavaScript source files. Details can be found in section 3.2.1 JavaScript Files in the [Kinoma Platform Runtime](../../overview) overview document.

***
After the files have been imported, they are ready for editing and debugging.
