#KinomaJS Documentation Writer’s Guide
___##1	About This GuideThe purpose of this guide is to help ensure quality and consistency in the writing of the KinomaJS documentation suite and otherwise make the writing process and editing process go smoothly. If the multiple programmer-writers heed these guidelines, the editing that will be done to their drafts will go a lot faster and be a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.
*Although everything in this document provides useful guidance, guidelines to especially note (regarding issues commonly overlooked, for example) appear italicized like this for emphasis.*
Other documents you should consult (and why):* *Style Sheet for Kinoma Documentation*, which includes editorial style guidelines, including lower-level conventions such as whether to use contractions (like *don’t*; do not use them) but also more pervasive issues regarding terminology. The style guidelines are listed alphabetically for easy reference, but it’s good practice to quickly scan the list before you begin writing, to see if any of them particularly relate to your document. Some of them, like the conventions regarding code, apply nearly everywhere and can cause technical confusion if not followed.
* *Kinoma Documentation Template*, on which the formatting of Kinoma documentation is based. You will likely start from an existing (possibly skeletal) document, in which case you can just follow the formatting styles it uses, or copy something in it that has the format you want and replace the text. But if you need more guidance regarding the formatting, the *Kinoma Documentation Template* is the place to look for it.
**Note:** This less formal document doesn’t follow the editorial style guidelines or the formatting template and so should not be used as a model. For models, see the public KinomaJS documents.
Please feel free to consult with the editor (Caroline Rose, crose@differnet.com) if you have questions about any writing, editorial style, formatting, or procedural issues. Making guesses or assumptions may lead to a proliferation of inconsistencies or other problems that will take longer to fix in the end. The editor’s role is as much a consulting one during the writing process as it is one of cleanup and polishing after the fact.

##2	Procedural NotesIf you’re reading this guide now for orientation purposes only and are not yet ready to dig in and start writing, you can turn back to this section later.
If you’re creating a document from scratch, or nearly so, don’t bother to turn on change tracking in Word. The editor (or tech reviewers, when it gets to that stage) will read through everything. 
The editor will change-track all her edits (except maybe for minor formatting tweaks) so that you can easily spot what was edited in your draft. Ideally you would likewise return to the editor a draft in which only your changes from the one she sent you are marked. One way to do that would be to accept or reject each of her changes in turn. Here’s a less tedious alternative:
1.	Make a copy of the change-marked draft the editor sends you, renaming it in some distinct way (such as appending a hyphen and your initials).
2.	Accept all changes in the copy (a simple operation in Word).
3.	Consult the original change-marked draft to see what was edited, but work in the copy you made. That way only your most recent changes will be marked in the copy, which is what you’ll return to the editor. If you don’t agree with an edit, select that text and express your rejection in a Word comment.
You’ll iterate with the editor until the draft is ready for tech review (or publication).
*When rejecting an edit, do your best to state the reason for it and/or provide an alternative that you prefer. This is also a good practice when tech-reviewing someone else’s draft: say as much as you can up front to reduce the number of iterations.*

##3	About the KinomaJS DocumentsThe KinomaJS documentation suite consists of a tightly interwoven set of documents, and it’s important to know the connections between them.The documents in the KinomaJS suite started out as the KPR Development Notes, documents describing KinomaXML (then called KPR Markup) and KPR Touch, and other miscellaneous documents. These got reshuffled and renamed into the following:* *KinomaJS Overview* — This document provides information that developers need to know regardless of which KinomaJS development path they choose. It contains only conceptual and overview information, with examples to help orient the developer; it does not include reference-type details.
* *KinomaJS JavaScript API Reference*, *KinomaJS XML API Reference*, and documents on related modules, such as *KinomaJS Touch* — The documents in this set assume the reader is already familiar with the information provided in the *KinomaJS Overview* document (and possibly with other documents in the set). They all include reference-type details; those without *Reference* in the title precede such details with conceptual and overview information specific to the API being discussed.
---
##4	Document Structure and Writing GuidelinesThe documents in the KinomaJS documentation suite have the following structure (with close interrelationships among the different parts, as described in the sections below):
1.	Title (a table of contents will be generated automatically)
2.	“About This Document” section
3.	Introductory and conceptual/overview section(s) (except in the Reference documents)
4.	Reference section (except in the *KinomaJS Overview* document)
5.	Glossary (except in the Reference documents, because all of their terms are in the Glossary of the KinomaJS Overview document, which the *Reference* documents point to)
6.	Back matter (copyright and trademark “legalese”)
---
##4.1	 “About This Document” SectionThis first section very briefly introduces the subject of the document—just enough for readers to know they’ve turned to the correct document and to make sense of the rest of the section. It then states any prerequisite documents or knowledge that the document assumes the reader is familiar with, and shows (with very brief descriptions) how the document is organized. Usually that suffices, but any other general notes that apply to the entire document can be stated here as well (such as special typographic conventions used throughout the document, if there are any that need explaining).
*When stating prerequisite documents, do not also mention any of those documents’ prerequisites.*
---
##4.2	Introductory and Conceptual/Overview Section(s)Every KinomaJS document that does not have Reference in its title has a conceptual/overview section—or sections, depending on the amount of material—whose subsections provide information that’s basically everything except reference-type details (at least everything except complete reference details; some may be mentioned for purposes of illustration or explanation). This section typically:* Introduces features
* Defines concepts and terminology
* Presents tutorial-type information and examples
* Includes whatever else might be helpful toward understanding the subject of the document at a high level and applying its features to accomplish tasks
In other words, it provides a “big picture” or context for understanding what follows in the Reference section (or, in the case of the *KinomaJS Overview* document, what follows in the other KinomaJS documents). It need not, and usually should not, get into every last detail (reserving those for the Reference document or section); however, it should mention—at least in passing—every entity for which reference details are eventually provided.
All such sections are intended to be read sequentially and so should be ordered and written with that in mind. The logical flow from one section to the next is important—as it is from one paragraph to the next and even one sentence to the next, in any good writing. Most important, terms should not be used before they’ve been introduced, whether in the current document or in a prerequisite document.
*For things that readers should already know from the document’s prerequisite(s), avoid introducing them as if for the first time in the current document. You could instead, for example, begin with “Remember that” as an implicit reference back to something presented in a prerequisite document. Or you could simply include the prerequisite term(s) in the current document’s Glossary (generally a good idea, as a reminder).*
Although the reader can of course refer back to such sections at any time, they are likely to be consulted less often over time, and will generally not be accessed the same way as a Reference document or section or a Glossary (with the reader looking up specific details or definitions). Consistent with this, subheads within these sections are generally more functional (describing a feature or task) than reference-like (referring only to an API entity by name).
These sections would ideally go down only two levels below their top level—for example, to a level like 2.1.1—although one more (unnumbered) level down is available in a pinch. Broadly speaking, the higher-level a section, the lengthier it (including any subsections) should be. Whatever a section’s level, there should be some introductory text before its first subsection, if any (in other words, no two headings in a row without intervening text).
To the fullest extent reasonable, the connection between any heading and the introduction immediately following it should be obvious. If, for example, a heading includes a term or concept not explained until several paragraphs later (or worse, never explicitly mentioned in the entire section), it could confuse the reader.
Other guidelines regarding the content of these sections:
* Code examples (and note, “code” includes XML) should be useful/meaningful; avoid obviously contrived examples. That said, to keep examples simple they may not be entirely “real world” either.* Where code examples are provided and the connection between the example and discussion preceding it might not be completely obvious, the example should be at least briefly introduced first. Further elaboration can follow the code.* Graphics should be included to the fullest extent reasonable: diagrams, screen shots, output displayed by example code, and so on. Along the same lines, very long lists containing similar information might best be presented in a table.
*Especially consider breaking up a section (with examples, graphics, tables, or subsections) if the text is running to more than about a page long.*
---
##4.3	Reference SectionEvery KinomaJS document except *KinomaJS Overview* has a Reference section that includes all the pertinent reference-type details and assumes the reader already knows the related introductory and conceptual/overview information. The Reference section is not meant to be read sequentially, so names of reference items, such as elements or attributes, are ordered alphabetically (with the exception that parameters are listed and described in order of appearance).
*In a Reference section, do not include explicit cross-references to related introductory and conceptual/overview documentation. If such a cross-reference seems necessary, consider whether key information is missing that should be included in the Reference section.*
Reference subsections often have a lot of subheads and terse descriptions (just the facts, since the context, usage notes, and so on are covered earlier). Consequently, the Reference section may need to have an introduction that explains the categories of information its subsections provide, any defaults being assumed for brevity, and so on. For example, the introduction to a Reference section might say that any attribute not marked as required within that section is optional, and tell what default values are assumed for undefined attributes.
A reference subsection may begin (before the first subhead within it) with a very brief description of the corresponding reference item, as a quick summary/reminder; however, doing so is not advised if a small screen shot would serve the same purpose (without explanation) or if the descriptive information would be completely obvious (that is, no description is needed beyond what the reference details go on to explain).
*Do not include code examples in reference subsections; put them only in the earlier introductory and conceptual/overview section(s).*
---##4.4	GlossaryWith the exception of the *Reference* documents, every KinomaJS document ends with a Glossary that must include all terms defined (in italic) in the current document. It may also include terms that are used in the current document but are not defined in it because they’re assumed to already be understood from prerequisite knowledge or a prerequisite document.
Glossary entries take this form:
* A heading consisting of the term being defined
* A description of the term, as follows:  
Partial sentence. [Optional complete sentence(s).]
Wherever reasonable, the term being defined should be singular rather than plural. Related items (such as “horizontal extent” and “vertical extent”) should not be combined into a single entry (such as “horizontal and vertical extent”). Glossary entries may cross-reference each other (as in “See also vertical extent”) but may not refer to other sections of the document.
 As much as possible, terms should be defined the same way in the glossaries of all the KinomaJS documents. If a term has a different meaning in the current document than in another KinomaJS document (or than in the world at large), you can clarify that in the definition by, for example, beginning it with “In <the current context>, …”. 
*Create glossary items while you’re writing rather than at the last minute; it can help clarify your thinking about what things mean, exactly. Define things by what they are, not just what they do, and in the singular (“A <something> is …”) rather than the plural, which can be ambiguous. Check that the usage of each term is consistent throughout the document, and in related KinomaJS documents if applicable; where possible, lift definitions directly out of other documents’ glossaries.*

##5	Final ChecksSome final checks you’re strongly recommended to make before turning over a draft for editing:
* Spelling/grammar check (if possible in the editor being used) — This can reveal much more than minor errors; it can uncover inconsistent terminology and even technical errors—and note, content that uses the formatting styles defined for showing code will by default not be spell-checked, so that will save time and bother. * Terminology check — For each term in the Glossary, or at least those that are used extensively, searching for the term throughout the document will help ensure that its usage is consistent. * Organization check — Reviewing the table of contents is an excellent way to check the organization of the document and the flow and consistency among its headings.* Overall comprehension/consistency check — As the very last check, reading through the entire draft from beginning to end without interruption (even if you think you’ve already checked and fixed everything possible) often brings problems to light that you can’t see nearly as well if you’ve previously focused on only one section at a time.
**This is a good idea even for—in fact, especially for—previously existing parts of the draft that you didn’t touch at all on this pass. It helps ensure that the old and new material mesh well together.**
